# PlayStation 2 Dualshock wireless controller embedded driver for Rust
**This library has only been tested on an Raspberry PI 3B+, Arduino Nano (atmega328p) and an Arduino Uno (atmega328p).**

In theory, the controller should operate via an SPI bus. But I couldn't get it to work. But you can easily make it work on any digital pins.
The controller operates at a frequency of 250 kHz
